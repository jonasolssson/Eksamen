                <h1>Stuff you didn´t know about brownies!</h1>
                    
                <p>
                    Guess you didn´t know the first brownie came around from a request for 
                    a dessert more suitable for ladies huh? We didn´t either. Diving deep into
                    the history of the most delicious treat known to mankind has been tickling
                    our brains for a while, and we thought we should share some of our findings
                    with you!
                </p>

                <h3>The origin of the brownie</h3>
                
                <p>
                    As mentioned the brownie came to be from a request of a bit of an
                    old-fashioned style. Bertha Palmer, whose husband owned the 
                    <em>Palmer House Hotel</em> wanted to add a new sort of dessert to 
                    the hotel´s menu. A cake-like confection was requested. Palmer requested
                    the dessert in question to be compact and packable, preferably to fit in a lunch box!
                    The result was the brownie, basically a chocolate cake made with the abscence of baking powder.
